# OpenBMC MRW Requirements

This document describes the data requirements that OpenBMC has on the machine
readable workbook XML generated by [Serverwiz2](https://www.github.com/open-power/serverwiz).
The requirements in this document are broken up by the OpenBMC functions that
use them.

If a particular OpenBMC implementation doesn't use a certain function,
then that MRW data isn't required.

## System Inventory

The system inventory can be generated from the MRW XML.  The inventory
typically contains all FRUs (field replaceable units), along with a few
non-FRU entities, like the BMC chip and processor cores.

To specify a target in the MRW should be in the inventory:

* Set the FRU_NAME attribute of that target.

**Note**: The BMC and cores will be automatically added without the need to
set FRU_NAME.
